## Origin Story

Ania Wysocka had a panic attack during her 4th year of university. She couldn't find an app that actually helped in the moment—everything was focused on meditation or long-term therapy, not immediate relief.

So she decided to build one herself. **No coding experience. No tech background.** Just a problem that needed solving.

### The Key Insight

Most mental health apps focus on prevention. Rootd focuses on **rescue**—what to do when you're having a panic attack right now.

This positioning made all the difference.

## How They Validated

Before building anything complex, Ania:

1. **Talked to therapists** - Validated that her approach was sound
2. **Joined anxiety support groups** - Found hundreds of people with the same problem
3. **Built a landing page** - Got 1,000+ email signups before launch
4. **MVP in 3 months** - Used no-code tools and contract developers

### Early Traction

- Week 1: 5,000 downloads (from Product Hunt launch)
- Month 1: 50,000 downloads (Reddit + anxiety communities)
- Month 6: 250,000 downloads (organic + word of mouth)

The app went viral because **it solved a painful problem really well**.

## Growth Playbook

### 1. Community-Led Growth

Rootd didn't pay for ads initially. Instead, they:

- Posted helpful content in r/Anxiety and r/PanicAttack
- Engaged authentically (no spamming)
- Let the community discover and share the app naturally

**Result:** 40% of early users came from Reddit.

### 2. App Store Optimization (ASO)

They nailed their keywords:

- "panic attack relief"
- "anxiety help now"
- "panic button"

These high-intent searches drove consistent organic downloads.

### 3. Press & Features

Getting featured by **Apple** was the turning point:

- App Store "App of the Day" → 500K downloads in one week
- Featured in Health & Fitness category
- Reached #3 in Health & Fitness charts

**Lesson:** Build something exceptional and apply for App Store features early and often.

### 4. Word of Mouth

The best growth loop: **The app works, so people tell others about it.**

When someone has a panic attack and Rootd helps them through it, they remember. They tell their therapist. They tell their support group. They leave a 5-star review.

## UX Breakdown

### The "Rootr" Panic Button

The core feature is brilliant in its simplicity:

- Big red button that says "I'M PANICKING"
- Tap it → Guided breathing exercise starts immediately
- No login required. No setup. Just help.

This instant relief is what makes the app sticky.

### Onboarding Flow (25 Steps)

Most apps would fail with a 25-step onboarding. But Rootd's works because:

1. **It's educational** - Teaches you about panic attacks
2. **It's personalized** - Asks about your triggers and symptoms
3. **It builds trust** - By the end, you feel like the app "gets you"

The onboarding itself becomes part of the therapy.

### Daily Lessons & Exercises

The app includes:

- CBT-based lessons
- Breathing exercises
- Guided visualizations
- Panic attack journal

All designed to work in **5-10 minute sessions** (perfect for anxious people who can't commit to long meditations).

## Monetization Strategy

### Freemium Model

**Free:**
- Panic button (core feature)
- Limited lessons
- Basic breathing exercises

**Premium ($5.99/month or $34.99/year):**
- Full CBT lesson library (50+ lessons)
- Unlimited emergency sessions
- Progress tracking
- Offline access

### Conversion Rate: ~5%

About 200,000 of the 4M users converted to paid. That's **$1M+ ARR**.

### Why People Pay

1. **The free version works** - Proves the value immediately
2. **The paid version adds depth** - More lessons, more tools
3. **It's cheaper than therapy** - $35/year vs. $100+/session

### Pricing Psychology

The annual plan ($34.99) is positioned as "less than one therapy session." This comparison anchor makes it feel like a steal.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Solve a Real, Painful Problem

Ania didn't build an app because she wanted to be an entrepreneur. She built it because she had a panic attack and couldn't find help. **That authenticity shows.**

### 2. Non-Technical Founders Can Win

You don't need to code. You need to:
- Understand the problem deeply
- Hire good developers
- Focus on UX and positioning

### 3. Community > Ads (Early On)

Rootd spent $0 on ads for the first year. Instead, they:
- Engaged in relevant communities
- Created helpful content
- Let the product speak for itself

### 4. Freemium Done Right

The free version is genuinely useful. The paid version is genuinely better. **No bait-and-switch.**

### 5. ASO Matters

Getting to the top of App Store search for "panic attack" was game-changing. Keywords, screenshots, and reviews all contributed.

**Steal This:**

- Build your core feature to work **instantly** (no login walls)
- Make your onboarding educational, not just data collection
- Use communities where your users already hang out
- Position pricing relative to the expensive alternative (therapy, coaching, etc.)
- Apply for App Store features—worst case, they say no
